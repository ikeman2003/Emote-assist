          <h3>What's This?</h3>
          <p>
            There's no doubt you've been on Twitch at least once, and have seen
            random words like KEKW, LETHIMCOOK, or OMEGALUL and have likely been
            very confused and just shrugged off as nothing. Or maybe you even
            have the means necessary to see some of them, yet you still see them
            sometimes. But I have the solution for both problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are in case number one, then you need to get an emote
            extension. Which you can get links to, whichever extension of your
            choosing via the three links above. An emote extension is basically
            an extension that will convert these text into emotes via third
            party API. If you're just starting out, then there really isn't a
            wrong answer when you're choosing one of the three. So long as you
            have the correct options on, so you can see the emotes from the
            other two parties. And if you are in case #2, no matter which of the
            three you are using, you can see all three platforms and I'll show
            you how.
